# Viz_Final_Project

This project is a visualizion with the intent of demonstrating that the countries that contribute the most to climate change are not the ones that are most vulnerable to the adverse effects. It was created by Mike Pine, Margo Urheim, and Bryce Walsh as a final project for the Visualization class at Tufts University in spring of 2020.

A live demo of the visualization is available at https://bryce-walsh.github.io/Viz_Final_Project/final_viz.html
